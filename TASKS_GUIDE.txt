# TexasHoldem Project - TASKS GUIDE

## MVP Phase Tasks

### Milestone 1: Core Game Logic - Basic Structure (Completed)
- Implement basic data structures (Card, Deck, Player, GameState, SeatStatus, ActionEvent).

### Milestone 2: Core Game Logic - Betting and Pot (Implemented & Initially Verified)
- Implement BasePhase and the state machine framework.
- Implement GameState for betting round control.
- Implement PotManager for standard side pot calculations and distribution.
- Implement action validation and intelligent conversion.
- Implement GameState with transactional context manager and clone method.
- Define business exceptions (PokerGameError, InvalidActionError).

### Milestone 3: Core Game Logic - Phases Implementation (Implemented & Initially Verified)
- Implement specific Phase subclasses (PreFlop, Flop, Turn, River, Showdown).
- Implement chip conservation logic across all phases.

### Milestone 4: Testing and Verification (Ongoing)
- Implement basic unit tests (PotManager related tests).
- Implement AI simulation test for end-to-end game flow and chip conservation.
- Verify game flow, betting, and settlement are correct and comply with poker rules through AI simulation.
- **已完成对Pre-flop阶段底池计算和行动顺序bug的修复与验证。**
- **核心游戏逻辑已实现基础框架，并通过初步测试，但需要持续集成测试和验证。**
